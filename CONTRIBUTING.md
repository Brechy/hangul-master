# Contribute to Hangul Master

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Hangul Master! This is a simple React project that I created for anyone to use. In the spirit
of making it open for everyone to use, I would love the open source community to contribute to the project to make it the best it can be. Lets work 
together to make this one of the most valuable Korean language learning tools available on the interwebs!

# The importance of following these guidelines
>Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

### How you can help
Hangul Master can always use great folks to improve documentation, find and fix bugs, creating tutorials, adding features, or suggesting enhancements. Since it is currently in MVP stage of development, there is a lot of room for improvement, so open an Issue if you want to help or have any ideas for improvement!

# Ground Rules

> Responsibilities
> * Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
> * Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
> * Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
> * Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

# Your First Contribution

> Unsure where to begin contributing to Hangul Master? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:
> Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
> Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.
> Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

Here are a couple of friendly tutorials you can include: http://makeapullrequest.com/ and http://www.firsttimersonly.com/

# Getting started

>1. Create your own fork of this repo
>2. Make a branch specifically for your changes. Name the branch after the Issue# if possible. 
>3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Be sure you have checked the Code of Conduct for this project.
    * Be sure your PR is descriptive of the change being made. 

>As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
>* Spelling / grammar fixes
>* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
>* Comment clean up
>* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
>* Adding logging messages or debugging output
>* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
>* Moving source files from one directory or package to another

# How to report a bug
> If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email security@brechy.net instead.

> In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
> * Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
> * Can I disable something for other people?
>
> If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at security@brechy.net

### Suggesting Enhancements

> If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in Hangul Master, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Open an issue which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work. Please make sure to include the Enhancement label too!

# Code review process
So far this is a solo personal project, so please be patient as Code Review may take more time that we would all like. Brechin will review Issues and PRs once a week, make any change requests as needed, and accept or close Issues/PRs. Issues may be closed after 2 weeks of inactivity, but feel free to comment on the Issue if you still think is is valid. If your active PR is accepted, expect to see a merge within 24-48 hours and your changes go live!
